# VE270 Lecture 13 RTL Design

## Components

-   Controllers (FSM)
    -   Describes behavior of circuits
    -   Takes inputs, generates outputs
    -   Implement with **state register** and **combinational logic**
-   Data-path components
    -   Operations on data
    -   Path that data flows through
    -   Places data is stored
-   Digital Device
    -   Controller and data-path components work together.
    -   Implementation of an algorithm
    -   Design on Register transfer level

## RTL Design Method

### Capture a high-level state machine

Describe the system's desired behavior as a high-level state machine, consists of states and transitions. It is more than just Boolean operations on bit inputs and outputs.

### Create a data-path

Create a data-path to implement data operations of the high-level state machine.

### Connect the data-path to controller

Connect data-path to controller block. Connect external Boolean inputs and outputs to controller.

### Divide the controller's FSM

Convert high-level state machine to FSM. Replace data operations with setting and reading of control signals to and from the data-path.
